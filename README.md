# Pause All Videos

## What is this?

This browser extension adds a simple button that lets you pause every video you
have running, in every tab, in every window. You could have 500 videos playing
at once and this button will stop them right in their tracks.

## When would I ever use that?

This tool is intended to help people who have lots (maybe even hundreds!) of
tabs open. When they restore all those tabs at once, their open videos might
start playing! Instead of having to search through all the open windows and
pause the videos one by one, this extension gives a simple button that pauses
every video at once.

## How do I install it?

You can get this extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pause-all-videos/mmnnojmlbmhajhklfknapikeonpjcfpf).
