# PauseAllVideos

_A Chrome extension that pauses all videos_

This tool is intended to help people who have lots (maybe even hundreds!) of
tabs open. When they restore all those tabs at once, their open videos might
start playing! Instead of having to search through all the open windows and
pause the videos one by one, this extension gives a simple button that pauses
every video at once.
